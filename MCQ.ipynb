Oaten, Professor of History at Presidency.[9] Before the incident, it was claimed by the students, Oaten had made rude remarks about Indian culture, and collared and pushed some students; according to Oaten, the students were making an unacceptably loud noise just outside his class.[9] A few days later, on 15 February, some students accosted Oaten on a stairway, surrounded him, beat him with sandals, and took to flight.[9] An inquiry committee was constituted. Although Oaten, who was unhurt, could not identify his assailants, a college servant testified to seeing Subhas Bose among those fleeing, confirming for the authorities what they had determined to be the rumor among the students.[9] Bose was expelled from the college and rusticated from University of Calcutta.[64] The incident shocked Calcutta and caused anguish to Bose's family.[53] He was ordered back to Cuttack. His family's connections were employed to pressure Asutosh Mukherjee, the Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta University.[64] Despite this, Subhas Bose's expulsion remained in place until 20 July 1917, when the Syndicate of Calcutta University granted him permission to return, but to another college.[10] He joined Scottish Church College, receiving his B.A. in 1918 in the First Class with honours in philosophy, placing second among all philosophy students in Calcutta University.[65]\", 'tone': 'simple', 'number': 5, 'subject': 'subhash chandra bose', 'response_json': '{\"1\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"2\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"3\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"4\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"5\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}}', 'quiz': '```json\\n{\\n  \"1\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"Why did Subhas Bose travel to Northern India during the long vacations of 1914?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"To search for a spiritual guru\",\\n      \"b\": \"To study philosophy\",\\n      \"c\": \"To meet his brothers\",\\n      \"d\": \"To take a break from college\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"a\"\\n  },\\n  \"2\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"What was the consequence of the incident involving Professor Oaten?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"Bose was expelled from college\",\\n      \"b\": \"Bose\\'s family disowned him\",\\n      \"c\": \"Oaten resigned from his position\",\\n      \"d\": \"The students were suspended\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"a\"\\n  },\\n  \"3\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"How did Subhas Bose\\'s family react to his expulsion?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"They were anguished and upset\",\\n      \"b\": \"They were supportive of his actions\",\\n      \"c\": \"They were glad he was finally focusing on studies\",\\n      \"d\": \"They didn\\'t care either way\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"a\"\\n  },\\n  \"4\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"What did Subhas Bose study at Scottish Church College?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"History\",\\n      \"b\": \"Philosophy\",\\n      \"c\": \"Science\",\\n      \"d\": \"Law\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"b\"\\n  },\\n  \"5\": {\\n    \"mcq\": \"When was Bose\\'s expulsion finally lifted?\",\\n    \"options\": {\\n      \"a\": \"1916\",\\n      \"b\": \"1917\",\\n      \"c\": \"1918\",\\n      \"d\": \"1919\"\\n    },\\n    \"correct\": \"b\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```'}\n"
